# Journey-Man-Game
This was the final project for my grade 11 computer science course. It is a text based adventure and combat game.

##  Features:
- Spells for combat
- Text-based combat
- NPC trading system
- Many levels with different opportunities and obstacles
- Food system for player and transport creature

## What I learned how to:
- Use the OOP approach
- Implement inheritence and polymorphism (Weapon and Bow, NPC and Trader and Monster)
- Make different classes and objects interact effectively
- Work with arraylists for easy of use
- Use constants to improve readability of the code
